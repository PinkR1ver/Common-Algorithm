## Decision Trees
A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes)

## Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.
